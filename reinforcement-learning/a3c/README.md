This implements the A3C algorithm as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783. It
runs by default on Space Invaders, and achieves an average score of 550-600
after about 5 million training steps, which corresponds to 20 million frames in
the game. I would run it for longer and optimise the hyperparameters more, but
I'm just using my Macbook to train.

Here is one episode after about 10 million training steps:
